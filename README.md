## Introduction
The **Gen Z Slang Interpreter** is a playful programming language designed to resonate with the Gen Z community. It incorporates modern slang expressions and simplifies coding through relatable terminology. This interpreter allows users to write code using slang keywords, which are then translated into functional programming statements, making coding both fun and engaging.
